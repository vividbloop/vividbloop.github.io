</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I feel like if I don't wish for something enough, I fall into someone else's
 wish.</p>
<p>The world is violent - violent in the sense that people impel others to do
 things. <i>Imperio</i>. Desires pull at us like puppets.</p>
<p>For the longest time, I wanted to be an <u>artist</u>.</p>
<p>But I couldn't really conceive of what I'd <u>do</u>.</p>
<p>Dab the brush (not the ferrule - just the hairs) into the paint. Feel the
 gentle viscosity as I sweep the brush. The mental calculations of what shape
  is her torso? What shape is her head? Triumph when the teacher
   congratulates me. Stubborn denial when the teacher denigrates me. Finally
   , it's done, and I give it to people I care for...</p>
<p>No. None of that happened.</p>
<p>All I wanted was some kind of recognition (by what? TV? Newspaper? Be
 specific), some kind of fame (mortal? Immortal?)</p>
<p>And I didn't really wish for it. I would say it, sure, when someone asked me
 what I wanted to do. But if I met resistance, I'd quietly subsume my wish to
  theirs.</p>
<p>Night with my mom in her car.</p>
<p>I've been attending oil painting school since I was 8.</p>
<p>I tell her I want to take a year off between high school and college.</p>
<p>I want to follow my teacher; I've glorified her in my mind. This
 archaeologist illustrator turned surreal painter.</p>
<p>I want to travel across Europe, the Middle East. Paint what I see.</p>
<p>She yells.</p>
<p>Threatens to brake in the middle of the highway.</p>
<p>Maybe I tell her I don't want to go to college.</p>
<p>Why didn't I hold on to my wish?</p>
<p>But maybe the question is - </p>
<p>Why do we live in a world that doesn't, upon hearing the plainitive voice of
 our hearts, gently steer its currents there?</p>
<p>My path should have been smooth sailing, with little to no effort on my part.</p>
<p>After all, it didn't hurt anyone.</p>
<p>It was just my little wish.</p>
<p>Weak, formless as it was, like the wind bending reeds down, reality should
 have pressed itself to accomodate this small wish.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>Someone other than me had a <u>stronger</u> desire - that is, for me to <u>
never</u> pursue a creative career.</p>
<p>Someone had already put me in a blue suit in their dreams, plopped down a
 suburban house, a white picket fence, a fat pension for me.</p>
<p>And because I hadn't grown my wish big enough - like the way you spin and
 spin cotton candy until it's more voluminous than a child's head - because I
  hadn't spun out these pictures of me in a paint spattered smock, or the
   froideur of the wind while painting water - I got caught into her vortex.</p>
<p>The world is violent, and pocked with black holes.</p>
<p>The only thing you can do is spin, and spin, and spin your dreams, until
 people can't deny their gravitational force, and reality itself realigns
 , like bones sliding back into sockets, to your dream, which is by this
  point impregnable and awe-inspiringly, violently, bright.</p>
