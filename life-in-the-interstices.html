</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I realize now that your life doesn't break and become enormously your own
 after age 18, or even 21. I thought that all this was <u>leading up</u> to
  something. My efforts would culminate and I would no longer be <u>beholden
  </u>.</p>
<p>Social construct.</p>
<p>After I started thinking of work as school, everything became clear.</p>
<p>We're not <u>really</u> supposed to care about work (class).</p>
<p>The exact workplace (school) won't greatly impact our happiness, just our
 success.</p>
<p>We don't get <u>meaning</u> from homework (our workstreams)!</p>
<p>Sometimes the stated purpose of our organization (for schools - learning
, collaboration, leadership) are achieved, in small ways, in the ways we
 carried out for ourselves, a tenth of our real time (French V). Mostly, it's
  not - and we know it's kind of a farce, kind of something that's handed
   down by the bigwigs.</p>
<p>We get a salary (<u>grades</u>), the salary (<u>grade</u>) is higher as a
 function of how hard we try (<i>and not indicative at all of our real worth
 </i>).</p>
<p>It behooves society for us to stay in these institutions - we maintain the
 illusion of contributing to society in our industry-specific ways, but the
  real outcome that is desired is for our actions to be monitored coarsely
   (<u>where</u>, <u>when</u>, <u>what</u>, <u>who</u>), for us to maintain
    regular contact with tribes (<i>teams</i>) and circulate norms for us to
     not <u>attack</u> society.</p>
<p>People who couldn't <u>live like other people</u> (show up, maintain regular
 sleep, dietary, and movement routines) drop out. Their lifestyles used to
  seem so freeing to me, but I now see that they are misfits, and to <i>choose</i> a
   life like that is not common, it is more that misfits cannot <i>abide</i>
   this kind of a life.</p>
<p>Nobody cares about you. Just like in class, everyone has their own thing
 going on. No students "watch" each other, or police behavior, or snitch
  (unless it's a <u>hurtful</u> violation, again). If people are paying
   attention to anything, it's to their own lives outside of work (school
   ), crushes, how The Man sees their performance (newbies relegate this role to
    their boss, but those who have been in the workforce for more than a year
     understand that The Man is a dissipated thing, not your boss, not their
      boss, not State, not Federal, but rather all the terrible father
       figures we have collected over our lives, the image, the notion
       , nebulous, yet internalized by now and prone to making our anxiety
        uptick, and this perfect, indominitable, severe taskmaster is why
         adults don't need the threat of supervision in the form of a
          watchful supervisor the same way teen students do from teachers
          .) No one is policing each other.</p>
<p>And so - given these constrains, where does life happen?</p>
<p>In the cracks. Like grass growing through cracks in the sidewalk, as water
 poured in a jug that looked full with stones. We have fun in the time
  snatched while making breakfast, on our commute, between workstreams during
   context switches, and the blessed period after 5pm, and the odd seconds
    between wakefulness where you are only aware through smell and sight of
     another person than you in the bed.</p>
