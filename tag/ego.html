<p>I don't have the same heart I came into this work with.</p>
<p>I'm no longer looking to herald in the next data engineering innovation, push
 my knowledge of programming further, or treat work as an escape.</p>
<p>In other words, I don't look <u>down</u> on the stupid, drag + drop 100 files
 into 100 different folders, tedium, the equivalent of data janitorial work
  anymore.</p>
<p>And the fact that I no longer equate the <u>type</u> of work I do with my
 potential, is what lessened my hatred of work.</p>
<p>"Shoveling snow."</p>
<p>That's what Murakami said every job amounted to in the end.</p>
<p>And to see a ~70 year old with this same, snobby attitude as myself as a 22
-year-old - makes me feel <u>really</u> disappointed. Because there's nothing
 in the Ivy League curriculum, no stop on the 120+ IQ pipeline, where this
  point is hammered home. Everyone else like me <u>thinks they're too good</u>
  . (And the scary part is when people accept this consensus, and it becomes
   social reality - when people defer to this man, and believe the smell of
    the room is indeed as repugnant as his wrinkled nose makes it appear.)</p>
<p>Some of the concerns we had about this candidate:
    I have the feeling he's going to go rogue, and that he just wants to get
     closer to the data for self-serving reasons.
    Does he just want to write an expos√©?
    Will he find the work intellectually stimulating enough?</p>
<p>The idea: is there too much "I" in this candidate?</p>
<p>Can this candidate <i>serve</i>?</p>
<p>But isn't this a question for all of us?</p>
<p>Don't we all, on some degree or another, have our own personal vested
 interests we silently click, mouth words to, culminating in a destination
  only we want?</p>
<p>Does he only appear revolting to me because I see myself in him?</p>
<p>And what does this mean about my colleagues, who don't share this same
 sensitivity to ego, to id?</p>                </article>
