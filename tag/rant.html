</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I hate one of the "directors" here and his dirty tactics.</p>
<p>Generally, I don't respect anyone whose sole reason for me to do something is
 "because I'm your boss."</p>
<p>If you don't have a better reason than that, fuck you.</p>
<p>I'll do something because it's critical to operations, or because it improves
 efficiency, within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>I'll do something because it helps the team at large.</p>
<p>What I will not be happy about doing is something that helps <em>only</em> you
 because you're 1. lazy or 2. stupid.</p>
<p>I also will not be happy about doing something if I resist and you <i>insist
</i>, pulling your rank over me.</p>
<p>Today I was looking at a report with aforementioned person. I said I wasn't
 sure about one of the data fields and moved my mouse to investigate
 . He started saying, "no, we need to look at something else," I
  basically was going to be done in two seconds, but then he rapidly
   said "I've been here for a long time. You have to trust me on this. I know
    what I'm doing" and without giving me the time to respond, basically
     ejected me out of my fucking chair.</p>
<p>(Postscript: he doesn't know what he's doing because today was a windfall of
 a problem that he was supposed to solve back in September.)</p>
<p>(Postpostscript: he has pushed me, in ways that would seem rude to observers
, to give data that I knew could be wrong in certain aspects, and despite
 me saying repeatedly that this method was not good, seemed surprised when IT WAS WRONG.)</p>
<p>If you are going to appeal to authority, you better be ready for me to appeal
 to minority. I hate pulling this kind of shit, but if you're giving me that
  speech like "do you know who's in charge here?", I'm going to say this right
   back at you: "I feel really uncomfortable with your tone right now
   ." Loudly. Cause you know what today's ultra liberal universe points
    fingers at the most? White men making minorities/the powerless feel
     uncomfortable. (By the way, this guy is in our racial equity committee
     ! More on that later.)</p>
<p>I think playing victim is one of the pettiest things you can do, but the
 <em>pettiest</em> thing you can certainly do is override other people's judgements
  and physical space simply because of your <em>position</em>, which isn't a fucking
   real thing.</p>
<p>Later on, this person had the disgusting shamelessness to ask me to build a
 report in 1 hour to be used legitimately, at most, for 9 hours. I just
  gawked at him. You do know about something called a "build test debug
  " cycle right? Do you realize that things, accurate, fast things, can't
   just be built in the snap of a finger or because you <i>want</i> them? He is
    completely capable, too, of pulling various sources together to get the
     information he needs. <i>He just wanted a one button solution</i>. Yeah, I'm
      going to work overtime on <i>Chinese New Year's</i> so that you don't have
       to have to goddamned <i>headache</i> of interacting with GUIs from 3
        different platforms! Wow! How difficult! Anyway, I parroted his
         request back at him to emphasize how ridiculous he was - and how
          insulting it was for him to treat me like a personal servant/slave
          /widget - but I don't think he got it. I actually don't think he
           got it.</p>
<p>The appropriate way to do this is when I hold a meeting about this very thing, to
 inform me of requests of things you might want <i>2 months in advance</i>.</p>
<p>(We host meetings to get feedback, he doesn't come (because why would he give
 a shit about coming to a meeting where he's a mandatory attendee? why would
  he be respectful of an appropriate partitioning of tasks, or your time
  ?), he blames me 2 months later, etc.)</p>
<p>Will he ever learn?</p>
<p><i>No</i>.</p>
<p>Other things he does:
* Look at his phone while you're talking to him. It's as though you're just
 vapor. You just have to awkwardly trail off.
* Respond to an email while you're talking to him. He's not going to glance
 back up at you, so you just kind of have to leave.
* Only smile at you when he wants something.
* Be a big baby; <i>pound the desk</i>
* Be "the ring of inefficiency that is holding our entire office back. Maybe
 the nation" (quote from myself a year ago)</p>
<p>Something else he's done, that I've only ever seen my autistic 30 year old
 cousin still living with his parents do:</p>
<p>Once, I was showcasing a new report, where you could click on a box and it
 would show you a dropdown of possible selections. You're probably rereading the
  last sentence and going "huh" because using this <i>feature</i> is so basic
  , if a kid couldn't do this, we actually would label him as needing disability
   accommodations. I thought I was overexaggerating with my autistic cousin
    comparison, but maybe not. This director looks at the data validated
     field with a furrowed brow, turns to my manager afterwards and sighs
     , "change is hard." While I'm in the same room.</p>
<p>Yes, he complained about my product while <i>I was in the same room, to
 another person</i>, so that I could overhear him, but so that he wouldn't have
  to say it to me directly.</p>
<p>I understand that in tech, I'd have to deal with sexual harrassment and
 arrogant PhDs who refuse to use libs written by anyone else and bros who
  actually believe in agile/jira/<i>slack</i> and weeaboos who jerk off to
   anime figurines.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I believe that would be a better fate for me than having to spend
 another second of my life with this director.</p>                </article>
