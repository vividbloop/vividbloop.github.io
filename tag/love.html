<p>This isn't, on the whole, strictly true.</p>
<p>I should say, the men <u>I</u> prefer prefer averageness.</p>
<p>It's a love triangle, don't you see?</p>
<p>I must love the ones that share the same interests as me, but they must love
 a wallpaper, "your next door neighbor" kind of girl - not a woman - never in
  finance, never in the c suite - perhaps a mite better than her peers at
   some domestic task - known primarily for nothing at all. If thought of
   , perhaps thought of as cute, or shy, or with no adjective. Like water
   . Just there, a receptable.</p>
<p>The triangle is an object of balance.</p>
<p>Its geometry insists on stability.</p>
<p>And so we stay locked in this configuration.</p>
<p>The cruelty is that it is my very intelligence and aptitude for this culture
 that makes me love and valuate these men more. Your typical fade-to-the
 -background "moe loli" can't even appreciate the wit and skill of their
  admirers. Yet, even as my own dominance in these arenas open my eyes to
   theirs and make me gaze upon them admiringly as potential equals, and 
   <i>want</i> them for we are finally matched, for I have finally found a
    worthy companion on this journey of solitude, it's my very dominance that
     makes them overlook me as a romantic candidate.</p>
<p>A cruel angel's thesis, indeed.</p>                </article>
