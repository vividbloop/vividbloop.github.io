</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>For the past year I've found it pretty difficult to get mental peace.</p>
<p>I tried all sorts of things, like stretching, mindfulness etc.</p>
<p>What kept me going through discomfort/agony (depending on the day) was the dream of a life <i>other than this one</i>.</p>
<p>I found my daily life to be unbearable.</p>
<p>I felt like I had no future.</p>
<p>I predicted I would feel this way upon getting my first full time job.</p>
<p>When that feeling encroaches on me, I feel like I'd do anything to escape, kind of like how a drug addict might feel.</p>
<p>It's the feeling that on my tombstone they will write "and she made Excel reports." That because I'm quasi married, I'll never get to experience romance again, I won't have the chance for The Great Romance that apparently elevates my life to some other plane otherwise inaccessible. That my possibilities shred like zucchini in a processor.</p>
<p>The physical symptoms match up with anxiety, and I have concluded:</p>
<p>I have anxiety about having a dead end life.</p>
<p>I was about to type boring, but that's not quite it.</p>
<p>I am OK with a boring life that will lead somewhere unexpected. I can endure it.</p>
<p>I'm not OK with my days being written out for me, each page a day, and me just flipping through what has already been known.</p>
<p>The reason why I say anxiety is because it's just so far from reality.</p>
<p>In the past year, I've went to places and learned things that blew my mind.</p>
<p>Since me and K started our relationship, I continue to grow, the circumference of my freedom is still quite good, and yes - I still experience romance.</p>
<p>So it's not like having a job and an LRT freezes you in place.</p>
<p>But I'm <i>still</i> anxious.</p>
<p>And there are some things I'm legitimately anxious about - getting fired, paying rent, K getting fired, K paying rent, the looming future of our in laws and their desires, people yelling at me for unwarranted reasons at work, etc.</p>
<p>But mostly I'm anxious that my youth is gone.</p>
<p>I'm anxious I can never recover it.</p>
<p>That I went into another room, the room of Middle Age, but some of my friends are still in the Youth room, and I fear I can't join them (and I'm jealous - why do they get to stay there? But I also look down on them, a little.)</p>
<p>I feel trapped and I know I'm not trapped but <i>knowing</i> doesn't help the pressure on my ribs.</p>                </article>
