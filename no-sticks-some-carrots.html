</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>One of the oddest and most disheartening things I encounter in my government job is this:
We have like 30 policies that we try to get our organizations to do.
We make this big stink about it months in advance, and the week leading up to deadlines.
Then, when they fail to follow stated policy, what happens?
We punish them, yes?
Wrong.
We quietly mop up after their mistakes.
Revealing that all along, this whole push to get them to comply was a farce in the end.
With no stick to enforce what we tell them, we end up playing the role of tired mother overcompensating for her kids' mistakes.
And the kid?
The kid gets spoiled.
The kid realizes there's no teeth behind the threats.
Kids who do everything right look around and realize, hey, in the end, I'm being treated the same as kids who did the wrong thing.
Incentives for good work, for good behavior, are completely decimated by our unwillingness to follow through.
A weak government is actually more toxic than no government at all.
It would have been better to simply never state "this is mandatory", than to state it and let malingerers run scot free.</p>
