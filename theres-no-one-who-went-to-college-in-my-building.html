</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I feel slightly awkward with my cool Russian escape colleague who likes to
 use Marx as his computer background.</p>
<p>It's happened before that I'll befriend someone who seems different - maybe
 lower status, and older, somehow a "misfit" - and everything will be good
  for a while, but at a certain point they'll get <u>attached</u> to me.</p>
<p>They'll see me as their only portal to this world of creativity, energy, 
refinement, and higher education.</p>
<p>As my colleague-friend started waxing philosophical to me about the now
 closed Pearl Paint, at my desk, I was busy trying to seem just disinterested
  enough so that my boss didn't think I was initiating this friendship
  /malingering <u>this</u> much on the job/had anything in common with a guy
   who probably just seems to be an overweight manual laborer with sandwich
    stains on his tshirt, but also interested enough to signal to him that I
     appreciated him walking the 2 minutes to get to my corner of the office.</p>
<p>He finished up with, "Selling art is hard. Because think about it - how many
 friends do you have? That are college educated, who are in that world? How
  many people out there can actually appreciate, and will spend money
  , instead of putting it into savings or IKEA, for art? In my building
  , there are none. Just Russian immigrants. Old Russian men. Runaways. Some
   of them don't even speak English. I go up to their door, give them a doll
    that I made, they say 'what is that? Is that voodoo?' I have to come to
     work to find college educated people."</p>
<p>At which point he stopped and looked at me.</p>
<p>And I <u>get</u> that feeling.</p>
<p>Because that's how I feel about software developers. My brother. My cousin
. The ones I grew up with. As soon as I find others like them - the ones who
 buy Cherry MX keyboards, the ones who watch anime, the ones who have this
  dark and scathing humor, but are among the best people you could find, who
   don't tolerate societal idiocy just because you're supposed to, I get <u>
   obsessed</u>. I legitimately obsess over them, because there are so few of
    them for me, a lit/humanities student turned data analyst, working in
     education. They're the oases in the desert.</p>
<p>But it's just weird to be on the <u>receiving side</u>.</p>
