</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Relative A seems to follow cultural precepts too easily.</p>
<p>Without critical thinking, he glorifies whatever is being glorified as new or cool at the moment.</p>
<p>For instance, Smash.</p>
<p>"How can you enjoy it without knowing advanced tech? It can't be fun being crushed every match."</p>
<p>This, to me, demonstrates a basic misunderstanding of what games are for.</p>
<p>Im sure if I said that to him, he'd parrot to me some principles in his game design textbook or that he read on a nicely designed blog.</p>
<p>Relative B has very keen critical thinking, but lacks solidity.</p>
<p>He adapts his demeanor and opinions to bend to whoever's next to him in the room.</p>
<p>There is a lot of real world knowledge that I didn't get growing up.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get it by hanging out with more people now.</p>
<p>Even though I feel successful when I acquire it, the aims of such knowledge become more and more suspect to me as time goes on.</p>
<p>For instance, tips on how to game the system. Avoiding tax by putting in another address. Choosing a technical career to max out income. Not telling your employer you're seeking another job. Selecting neighborhoods to optimize for lifestyle and "bringing dates back".</p>
<p>What's popular now to meet new people, nightclubs, activities. Cultural touchstones at the moment, this rap artist, that game.</p>
<p>What is it all for?</p>
<p>The ease to which my relatives fit into their respective groups, slot into life - I envied that ease.</p>
<p>But there seems to me a surfeit of <i>things</i>, and a lack of <i>feeling</i>.</p>
